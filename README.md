# Revit from Scratch

This project is built purely for **learning and teaching purposes**.

The main goal is to **recreate a simplified version of Revit** to help plugin developers gain a deeper understanding of how Revit works under the hood. By simulating key aspects of Revit's behavior, geometry handling, and element management, this project serves as a learning tool to:

- Explore the architecture of a BIM application.
- Understand how Revit's internal systems might be structured.
- Provide a controlled environment to test and experiment with plugin-style extensions.

## Who Is This For?

- Revit plugin developers
- BIM software enthusiasts
- Anyone curious about building parametric modeling systems from scratch
